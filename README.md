<strong>TLDR:</strong> I enjoy solving problems using code, learning new things and leading teams.


Hi there, I'm Nicolas Guinet, a french senior software consultant based in Paris and London, mainly working into finance and industry sectors.   

The system is no longer linear. I like to discover new things and I take a lot of time learning from books, blogs or youtube about many topics. Isn't it the key, with the fast pace of new technologies, to get out of our comfort zone to enrich our proficiencies to be always in a renewing mindset to be on the first line of creation and innovation.   

Currently I'm diving in machine learning but I also like to work on the front-end, with almost unlimited possibilities it tickles our imagination to create awesome views. The back-end is more challenging with a "pen and paper first" approach, requiring more reflexion but it's catchy, it leads to discover and efficiency.   

I’ve been developing software professionally for more than 20 years now, starting at 13 with basic and 6502A assembler on Oric-1. I like using the latest trends, building and managing software teams (people often asking me <cite>"how to..."</cite>) and looking for the holy grail: shipping awesome software.
